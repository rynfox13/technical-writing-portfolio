# **Process Summary**

1. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - Review the public endpoints and check for any undocumented functions.
   - Meet with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to understand key use cases and known challenges.
   - Examine sample and testing code to ensure practical and accurate documentation.

2. **Outline and Planning**:
   - Create a document outline, including:
     - Authorization and authentication
     - Quickstart guide
     - API endpoint details
     - Error codes and handling
     - Sample program using the API

3. **Drafting**:
   - Draft in Markdown, starting with a sample program to verify API call functionality and understand usage.
   - Document each endpoint with clear descriptions, parameters, and example responses.
   - Write out authorization/authentication steps, followed by summaries and general information.

4. **Review and Feedback**:
   - Proofread for spelling, grammar, and clarity.
   - Use a git repository to create a pull request for client review.
   - Incorporate any client feedback and request further input as needed.

5. **Finalization**:
   - Finalize and commit changes after client approval.
   - Generate output files (e.g., PDF, HTML) as requested by the client.
