# Kathryn Fox's Technical Writing Portfolio
I am a technical writer with over 20 years of experience in the information technology field. Throughout my career, I have worked as a software developer, site reliability engineer, and security engineer at companies such as Google, Grubhub, and SiriusXM. In each of these roles, I was responsible for creating and maintaining team documentation.

Due to Non-Disclosure Agreements, I cannot share the documentation I developed for these companies or clients without explicit written permission. Instead, I have included a sample API project and a user guide to demonstrate my technical writing skills.

If you'd like to discuss your documentation needs or view additional samples, please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rynfox13/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/rynfox13).
